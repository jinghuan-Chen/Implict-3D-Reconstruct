# Implict-3D-Reconstruct
3D Reconstruction Base on Implict Method. This project aims to learn and improve implicit reconstruction methods based on deep learning.
#### Note1:Our implementation is based on [IM-NET](https://github.com/czq142857/IM-NET-pytorch), [BAE-NET](https://github.com/czq142857/BAE-NET).
##Updates
  1. Reproduce the IM-NET and BAE-NET based on object-oriented thinking.
  2. Improve the sampling algorithm to alleviate the problem of holes in the reconstructed surface caused by inputting large-resolution voxels.
